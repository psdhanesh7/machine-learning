Upon and subject to all of the terms and conditions hereof, Landlord hereby leases the Premises to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases the Premises from Landlord. The portions of the Project which are for the non-exclusive use of tenants of the Project are collectively referred to herein as the “ Common Areas. ” Landlord reserves the right to modify Common Areas, provided that such modifications do not materially adversely affect Tenant ’ s use of the Premises for the Permitted Use or increase the Rentable Area of the Premises above 16,429 square feet unless Tenant leases additional space at the Project; provided, however, if, following the completion of Landlord ’ s Work, Landlord thereafter reduces the size of the portion of the enclosed Common Areas (excluding the fitness center and bistro at the Project) which is included in Landlord ’ s calculation of the square footage of the Premises, the Rentable Area of the Premises will be reduced proportionately. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a reduction in the size of the fitness center or bistro result in a change of the Rentable Area of the Premises. From and after the Rent Commencement Date (as defined below) through the expiration of the Term, Tenant shall have access to the Premises for the Permitted Use and to the parking facilities serving the Project 24 hours per day , 7 days a week, except in the case of emergencies, as the result of Legal Requirements, the performance by Landlord of any necessary maintenance or repairs, or any other reasonable temporary interruptions, and otherwise subject to the terms of this Lease. 2.

Tenant shall deliver evidence of the insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease and the Work Letter along with Tenant ’ s delivery of an executed copy of this Lease to Landlord. Landlord shall use its reasonable efforts to Deliver the Premises by April 1 , 2012. If Landlord fails to timely Deliver the Premises, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, and this Lease shall not be void or voidable except as provided herein. If Landlord does not Deliver the Premises by June 1 , 2012, Tenant may terminate this Lease on 10 days prior written notice to Landlord unless Delivery of the Premises occurs during the 10 day period following Landlord ’ s receipt of such notice; provided, however, that if Tenant fails to provide such notice to Landlord on or before June 5 , 2012, Tenant shall have no further right to terminate this Lease pursuant to the provisions of this sentence. As used herein, the term “ Tenant ’ s Work ” shall have the meaning set forth for such term in the Work Letter. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that construction of the Tenant Improvements will be undertaken at the same time as Landlord is undertaking the construction of the Landlord ’ s Work (as defined in the Work Letter) and that the parties and their contractors will be required to coordinate their work with one another (including, without limitation, work within the Premises) but in no event may Tenant or any Tenant Party (as defined below) delay or interfere with the performance of Landlord ’ s Work, nor with any inspections or issuance of final approvals by applicable Governmental Authorities (as defined below) nor cause an increase the cost of the performance of Landlord ’ s Work. Tenant further acknowledges and agrees that Landlord ’ s Work includes, without limitation, the construction of a pass through lobby and common area restrooms and Landlord will also be accessing the Premises in connection with the construction of the same. The “ Commencement Date ” shall be the date Landlord Delivers the Premises to Tenant for construction of the Tenant Improvements. The “ Rent Commencement Date ” shall be July 1 , 2012; provided that if Tenant has not Substantially Completed the Tenant Improvements on or before July 1 , 2012, to the extent delays are attributable solely to Landlord Delays (as defined in the Work Letter), such date shall be extended 1 day for each day after July 1 , 2012, that Tenant is unable to Substantially Complete the Tenant Improvements because of such Landlord Delays. Upon request of Landlord, Tenant shall execute and deliver a written acknowledgment of the Commencement Date, the Rent Commencement Date and the expiration date of the Term when such are established in the form of the “ Acknowledgement of Commencement Date ” attached to this Lease as Exhibit D; provided, however, Tenant ’ s failure to execute and deliver such acknowledgment shall not affect Landlord ’ s rights hereunder.

The Landlord ’ s Property was located in the Building and Tenant acknowledges that all of Landlord ’ s Property was removed by Tenant prior to the date of this Lease for reuse as part of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant accepted Landlord ’ s Property in its current “ as is ” condition as of the date the same was removed from the Building and shall return Landlord ’ s Property to Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease in the same condition as received, ordinary wear and tear excepted. The reasonable costs associated with removing Landlord ’ s Property from the Building and storing the same and reusing it as part of the Tenant Improvements may be paid for out of the TI Allowance (as defined in the Work Letter).

Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, Landlord shall, at its sole cost and expense (which shall not constitute an Operating Expense), be responsible for any repairs that are required to be made to the Building structure, roof or Building Systems (as defined in Section 13) provided that Tenant notifies Landlord in writing of the need for any such repairs within 120 days after the Commencement Date. The cost of any repairs not identified in such notice during such 120 day period shall thereafter be included as part of Operating Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph, if Tenant or any Tenant Party was responsible for the cause of any of the repairs provided for in this paragraph, Tenant shall pay the full cost of such repairs. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that except as expressly set forth in this Lease, neither Landlord nor any agent of Landlord has made any representation or warranty with respect to the condition of all or any portion of the Premises or the Project, and/or the suitability of the Premises or the Project for the conduct of Tenant ’ s business, and Tenant waives any implied warranty that the Premises or the Project are suitable for the Permitted Use. This Lease constitutes the complete agreement of Landlord and Tenant with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior representations, inducements, promises, agreements, understandings and negotiations which are not contained herein.

Base Rent Adjustments. Base Rent shall be increased on each annual anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date (each an “ Adjustment Date ”) by multiplying the Base Rent payable immediately before such Adjustment Date by the Rent Adjustment Percentage and adding the resulting amount to the Base Rent payable immediately before such Adjustment Date. Base Rent, as so adjusted, shall thereafter be due as provided herein. Base Rent adjustments for any fractional calendar month shall be prorated. 5. Operating Expense Payments.

Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including, without limitation, Section 9 of this Lease, if, at any time after the date of this Lease, Landlord is successful in any of its appeals to obtain a lower tax basis for the Project which results in lower Taxes and Operating Expenses, Tenant ’ s monthly payment of Operating Expense will not be reduced to reflect such lower Taxes and Tenant shall pay Taxes and Operating Expenses to Landlord as though no such reduction had been obtained. Furthermore, Tenant shall pay the full amount of the annual statutory increases that would have been applicable if the reduction had not been obtained such that Tenant will pay Taxes during the Term as if no reduction in the property tax basis had occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, if Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses equated to $1 per square foot per month and the corresponding component for Taxes was reduced by $.10 per square foot per month as a result of a successful appeal, Tenant would still pay $1 per square foot per month in Operating Expenses plus any increases. Within 90 days after the end of each calendar year (or such longer period as may be reasonably required), Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement (an “ Annual Statement ”) showing in reasonable detail: (a) the total and Tenant ’ s Share of actual Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year, and (b) the total of Tenant ’ s payments in respect of Operating Expenses for such year. If Tenant ’ s Share of actual Operating Expenses for such year exceeds Tenant ’ s payments of Operating Expenses for such year, the excess shall be due and payable by Tenant as Rent within 30 days after delivery of such Annual Statement to Tenant. If Tenant ’ s payments of Operating Expenses for such year exceed Tenant ’ s Share of actual Operating Expenses for such year Landlord shall pay the excess to Tenant within 30 days after delivery of such Annual Statement, except that after the expiration, or earlier termination of the Term or if Tenant is delinquent in its obligation to pay Rent, Landlord shall pay the excess to Tenant after deducting all other amounts due Landlord. The Annual Statement shall be final and binding upon Tenant unless Tenant, within 90 days after Tenant ’ s receipt thereof, shall contest any item therein by giving written notice to Landlord, specifying each item contested and the reason therefor. If, during such 90 day period, Tenant reasonably and in good faith questions or contests the accuracy of Landlord ’ s statement of Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses, Landlord will provide Tenant with access to Landlord ’ s books and records relating to the operation of the Project and such information as Landlord reasonably determines to be responsive to Tenant ’ s questions (the “ Expense Information ”). If after Tenant ’ s review of such Expense Information, Landlord and Tenant cannot agree upon the amount of Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses, then Tenant shall have the right to have an independent public accounting firm selected by Tenant from among the 4 largest in the United States, working pursuant to a fee arrangement other than a contingent fee (at Tenant ’ s sole cost and expense) and approved by Landlord (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), audit and/or review the Expense Information for the year in question (the “ Independent Review ”). The results of any such Independent Review shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. If the Independent Review shows that the payments actually made by Tenant with respect to Operating Expenses for the calendar year in question exceeded Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses for such calendar year, Landlord shall at Landlord ’ s option either (i) credit the excess amount to the next succeeding installments of estimated Operating Expenses or (ii) pay the excess to Tenant within 30 days after delivery of such statement, except that after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or if Tenant is delinquent in its obligation to pay Rent, Landlord shall pay the excess to Tenant after deducting all other amounts due Landlord. If the Independent Review shows that Tenant ’ s payments with respect to Operating Expenses for such calendar year were less than Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses for the calendar year, Tenant shall pay the deficiency to Landlord within 30 days after delivery of such statement. If the Independent Review shows that Tenant has overpaid with respect to Operating Expenses by more than 5% then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for all costs incurred by Tenant for the Independent Review. Operating Expenses for the calendar years in which Tenant ’ s obligation to share therein begins and ends shall be prorated. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, if the Project is not at least 95% occupied on average during any year of the Term, Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses for such year shall be computed as though the Project had been 95% occupied on average during such year. Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 7 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Landlord shall have the right, from time to time during the Term, to re-measure the rentable square footage of the Premises and the square footage of Common Areas of the Project. Any such re-measurements shall be performed in accordance with the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) International, Gross Areas of a Building: Standard Methods of Measurement (2009). Tenant acknowledges and agrees that any measurement of the rentable square footage of the Premises shall include Tenant ’ s pro rata share of the Common Areas of the Project. If any such re-measurements determine that the actual rentable square footage of the Premises and/or the square footage of the Common Areas of the Project deviate from the rentable square footage specified in the definition of “ Premises ” on page 1 of this Lease and/or the actual square footage of the Common Areas of the Project applicable as of the Commencement Date, then, upon Landlord ’ s request, Landlord and Tenant shall cause this Lease shall be amended so as to reflect the actual square footage thereof in the definitions, as applicable, of “ Premises, ” “ Project, ” “ Rentable Area of Premises, ” “ Rentable Area of Project ” and “ Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses of Project ”; provided, however, that such re- measurement shall not affect the Base Rent payable under this Lease or the TI Allowance granted to Tenant but Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses shall be adjusted. In the event that Landlord does not re-measure the Premises and the Common Areas of the Project, then the square footages listed on page 1 of this Lease shall conclusively be deemed to be the rentable square footage of the Premises and the Project and shall not be subject to further re-measurement except as provided for in the next sentence. “ Tenant ’ s Share ” shall be the percentage set forth on the first page of this Lease as Tenant ’ s Share as reasonably adjusted by Landlord for increases or decreases in the physical size of the Premises or the Project occurring thereafter. Landlord may equitably increase Tenant ’ s Share for any item of expense or cost reimbursable by Tenant that relates to a repair, replacement, or service that benefits only the Premises or only a portion of the Project that includes the Premises or that varies with occupancy or use. Base Rent, Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses and all other amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder are collectively referred to herein as “ Rent. ” Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Rentable Area of Premises will not exceed 16,429 square feet during the Base Term or any extension of this Lease unless Tenant leases additional space at the Project, and (ii) for purposes of calculating Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses, Landlord may treat the Rentable Area of Project as being 65,314 sq. ft. 6. Security Deposit. Tenant shall deposit with Landlord, upon delivery of an executed copy of this Lease to Landlord, a security deposit (the “ Security Deposit ”) for the performance of all of Tenant ’ s obligations hereunder in the amount set forth on page 1 of this Lease, which Security Deposit shall be in the form of an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit (the “ Letter of Credit ”): (i) in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord, (ii) naming Landlord as beneficiary, (iii) expressly allowing Landlord to draw upon it at any time from time to time by delivering to the issuer notice that Landlord is entitled to draw thereunder, (iv) issued by an FDIC-insured financial institution satisfactory to Landlord, and (v) redeemable by presentation of a sight draft in the state of Landlord ’ s choice. If Tenant does not provide Landlord with a substitute Letter of Credit complying with all of the requirements hereof at least 10 days before the stated expiration date of any then current Letter of Credit, Landlord shall have the right to draw the full amount of the current Letter of Credit and hold the funds drawn in cash without obligation for interest thereon as the Security Deposit. The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for the performance of Tenant ’ s obligations under this Lease. The Security Deposit is not an advance rental deposit or a measure of Landlord ’ s damages in case of Tenant ’ s default. Upon each occurrence of a Default (as defined in Section 20), Landlord may use all or any part of the Security Deposit to pay delinquent payments due under this Lease, future rent damages under California Civil Code Section 1951.2, and the cost of any damage, injury, expense or liability caused by such Default, without prejudice to any other remedy provided herein or provided by law. Landlord ’ s right to use the Security Deposit under this Section 6 includes the right to use the Security Deposit to pay future rent damages following the termination of this Lease pursuant to Section 21 (c) below. Upon any use of all or any portion of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand the amount that will restore the Security Deposit to the amount set forth on Page 1 of this Lease. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of any law, now or hereafter in force, including, without limitation, California Civil Code Section 1950.7, which provide that Landlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of Rent, to repair damage caused by Tenant or to clean the Premises, it being agreed that Landlord may, in addition, claim those sums reasonably necessary to compensate Landlord for any other Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory loss or damage, foreseeable or unforeseeable, caused by the act or omission of Tenant or any officer, employee, agent or invitee of Tenant. Upon bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be deemed to be applied first to the payment of Rent and other charges due Landlord for periods prior to the filing of such proceedings. Upon any such use of all or any portion of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall, within 5 days after demand from Landlord, restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. If Tenant shall fully perform every provision of this Lease to be performed by Tenant, the Security Deposit, or any balance thereof (i.e., after deducting therefrom all amounts to which Landlord is entitled under the provisions of this Lease), shall be returned to Tenant (or, at Landlord ’ s option, to the last assignee of Tenant ’ s interest hereunder) within 90 days after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 8 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto agree that Tenant shall deposit the sum of $43,290.50 in cash (“ Initial Deposit ”) with Landlord as the Security Deposit under this Lease concurrent with Tenant ’ s delivery to Landlord of an original of this Lease executed by Tenant; provided, however, that Tenant shall replace the cash Security Deposit with a Letter of Credit in the amount of $43,290.50 on or before September 15 , 2011. Promptly after the delivery to Landlord of the approved and effective Letter of Credit in the amount of $43,290.50, Landlord shall return the Initial Deposit to Tenant. If Landlord transfers its interest in the Project or this Lease, Landlord shall either (a) transfer any Security Deposit then held by Landlord to a person or entity assuming Landlord ’ s obligations under this Section 6 with written notice to Tenant of such transfer, or (b) return to Tenant any Security Deposit then held by Landlord and remaining after the deductions permitted herein. Upon such transfer to such transferee or the return of the Security Deposit to Tenant, Landlord shall have no further obligation with respect to the Security Deposit, and Tenant ’ s right to the return of the Security Deposit shall apply solely against Landlord ’ s transferee. The Security Deposit is not an advance rental deposit or a measure of Landlord ’ s damages in case of Tenant ’ s default. Landlord ’ s obligation respecting the Security Deposit is that of a debtor, not a trustee, and no interest shall accrue thereon. 7. Use. The Premises shall be used solely for the Permitted Use set forth in the basic lease provisions on page 1 of this Lease, and in compliance with all applicable laws, orders, judgments, ordinances, regulations, codes, directives, permits, licenses, covenants and restrictions now or hereafter applicable to the Premises, and to the use and occupancy thereof, including, without limitation, the Americans With Disabilities Act , 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.

Tenant will not use or permit the Premises to be used for any purpose or in any manner that would void Tenant ’ s or Landlord ’ s insurance, increase the insurance risk to an unreasonable level, or cause the disallowance of any sprinkler or other credits. Tenant shall not permit any part of the Premises to be used as a “ place of public accommodation ”, as defined in the ADA or any similar legal requirement. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord promptly upon demand for any additional premium charged for any such insurance policy by reason of Tenant ’ s failure to comply with the provisions of this Section or otherwise caused by Tenant ’ s use and/or occupancy of the Premises. Tenant will use the Premises in a careful, safe and proper manner and will not commit or permit waste, overload the floor or structure of the Premises, subject the Premises to use that would damage the Premises or obstruct or interfere with the rights of Landlord or other tenants or occupants of the Project, including conducting or giving notice of any auction, liquidation, or going out of business sale on the Premises, or using or allowing the Premises to be used for any unlawful purpose. Tenant shall cause any equipment or machinery to be installed in the Premises so as to reasonably prevent sounds or vibrations from the Premises from extending into Common Areas, or other space in the Project. Tenant shall not place equipment exceeding the floor load capacity in or upon the Premises or transport or move such items through the Common Areas of the Project or in the Project elevators without the prior written consent of Landlord.

No holding over by Tenant, whether with or without consent of Landlord, shall operate to extend this Lease except as otherwise expressly provided, and this Section 8 shall not be construed as consent for Tenant to retain possession of the Premises. Acceptance by Landlord of Rent after the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this Lease shall not result in a renewal or reinstatement of this Lease. 9. Taxes. Landlord shall pay, as part of Operating Expenses (with Tenant not receiving any benefits from any successful tax appeals), all taxes, levies, fees, assessments and governmental charges of any kind, existing as of the Commencement Date or thereafter enacted (collectively referred to as “ Taxes ”), imposed by any federal, state, regional, municipal, local or other governmental authority or agency, including, without limitation, quasi-public agencies (collectively, “ Governmental Authority ”) during the Term, including, without limitation, all Taxes: (i) imposed on or measured by or based, in whole or in part, on rent payable to (or gross receipts received by) Landlord under this Lease and/or from the rental by Landlord of the Project or any portion thereof, or (ii) based on the square footage, assessed value or other measure or evaluation of any kind of the Premises or the Project, or (iii) assessed or imposed by or on the operation or maintenance of any portion of the Premises or the Project, including parking, or (iv) assessed or imposed by, or at the direction of, or resulting from Legal Requirements, or interpretations thereof, promulgated by any Governmental Authority, or (v) imposed as a license or other fee, charge, tax, or assessment on Landlord ’ s business or occupation of leasing space in the Project. Landlord may contest by appropriate legal proceedings the amount, validity, or application of any Taxes or liens securing Taxes. Taxes shall not include any net income taxes imposed on Landlord except to the extent such net income taxes are in substitution for any Taxes payable hereunder. If any such Tax is Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory levied or assessed directly against Tenant, then Tenant shall be responsible for and shall pay the same at such times and in such manner as the taxing authority shall require. Tenant shall pay, prior to delinquency, any and all Taxes levied or assessed against any personal property or trade fixtures placed by Tenant in the Premises, whether levied or assessed against Landlord or Tenant. If any Taxes on Tenant ’ s personal property or trade fixtures are levied against Landlord or Landlord ’ s property, or if the assessed valuation of the Project is increased by a value attributable to improvements in or alterations to the Premises, whether owned by Landlord or Tenant and whether or not affixed to the real property so as to become a part thereof, higher than the base valuation on which Landlord from time-to-time allocates Taxes to all tenants in the Project, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pay such Taxes. Landlord ’ s determination of any excess assessed valuation shall be binding and conclusive, absent manifest error. The amount of any such payment by Landlord shall constitute Additional Rent due from Tenant to Landlord immediately upon demand. Landlord shall not include in the Operating Expenses payable by Tenant any assessed valuation attributable solely to (i) the personal property or trade fixtures of other tenants at the Project, and (ii) improvements in the premises of other tenants at the Project which are materially higher than the base valuation on which Landlord from time-to-time allocates Taxes to all tenants in the Project. 11119 N.

Subject to all matters of record, Force Majeure, a Taking (as defined in Section 19 below) and the exercise by Landlord of its rights hereunder, Tenant shall be allocated 3 parking spaces per 1,000 usable square feet of the Premises, in common with other tenants of the Project in those areas designated for non-reserved parking, subject in each case to Landlord ’ s rules and regulations, at no cost to Tenant. Landlord may allocate parking spaces among Tenant and other tenants in the Project pro rata as described above if Landlord determines that such parking facilities are becoming crowded. Included in the number of spaces allocated to Tenant pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 10 will be 2 spaces identified by Landlord located in front of the Building which shall be marked as Tenant visitor spaces. Landlord shall not be responsible for enforcing Tenant ’ s parking rights against any third parties, including other tenants of the Project or for enforcing any reservation of parking spaces. 11. Utilities, Services. Landlord shall provide, subject to the terms of this Section 11, water, electricity, heat, light, power, sewer, and other utilities (including gas and fire sprinklers to the extent the Project is plumbed for such services), refuse and trash collection and janitorial services (collectively, “ Utilities ”). Landlord shall pay, as Operating Expenses or subject to Tenant ’ s reimbursement obligation, for all Utilities used on the Premises, all maintenance charges for Utilities, and any storm sewer charges or other similar charges for Utilities imposed by any Governmental Authority or Utility provider, and any taxes, penalties, surcharges or similar charges thereon. Landlord may cause, at Tenant ’ s expense, any Utilities to be separately metered or charged directly to Tenant by the provider. Tenant shall pay directly to the Utility provider, prior to delinquency, any separately metered Utilities and services which may be furnished to Tenant or the Premises during the Term. Tenant shall pay, as part of Operating Expenses, its share of all charges for jointly metered Utilities based upon consumption, as reasonably determined by Landlord. No interruption or failure of Utilities, from any cause whatsoever other than Landlord ’ s willful misconduct, shall result in eviction or constructive eviction of Tenant, termination of this Lease or the abatement of Rent. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to correct interruptions or failures of Utilities which are within the reasonable control of Landlord to correct within a reasonable period of time after Tenant provides Landlord with notice or such interruption or failure. Tenant agrees to limit use of water and sewer with respect to Common Areas to normal restroom use. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if (i) a stoppage of an Essential Service (as defined below) to the Premises shall occur and such stoppage is due solely to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord and not due in any part to any act or omission on the part of Tenant or any Tenant Party or any matter beyond Landlord ’ s reasonable control (any such stoppage of an Essential Service being hereinafter referred to as a “ Service Interruption ”), and (ii) such Service Interruption continues for more than 5 consecutive business days after Landlord shall have received written notice thereof from Tenant, and (iii) as a result of such Service Interruption, the conduct of Tenant ’ s normal operations in the Premises are materially and adversely affected, then, there shall be an abatement of one day ’ s Base Rent for each day during which such Service Interruption continues after such 5 business day period; provided, however, that if any part of the Premises is reasonably useable for Tenant ’ s normal Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory business operations or if Tenant conducts all or any part of its operations in any portion of the Premises notwithstanding such Service Interruption, then the amount of each daily abatement of Base Rent shall only be proportionate to the nature and extent of the interruption of Tenant ’ s normal operations or ability to use the Premises. The rights granted to Tenant under this paragraph shall be Tenant ’ s sole and exclusive remedy resulting from a failure of Landlord to provide services, and Landlord shall not otherwise be liable for any loss or damage suffered or sustained by Tenant resulting from any failure or cessation of services. For purposes hereof, the term “ Essential Services ” shall mean the following services: access to the Premises, HVAC service, water, sewer and electricity, but in each case only to the extent that Landlord has an obligation to provide same to Tenant under this Lease. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 11 At least once per month as part of the maintenance of the Building, Landlord shall run the emergency generator for a period reasonably determined by Landlord for the purpose of determining whether it operates when started.

Landlord shall make the service contract and maintenance records (including Landlord ’ s monthly maintenance records) and permits for the generators reasonably available to Tenant for Tenant ’ s review upon Tenant ’ s prior written request. Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant ’ s requests so that Tenant can assess whether the emergency generator is being maintained as per the manufacturer ’ s standard guidelines and whether the applicable service contract needs to be amended to address any guidelines that are not included in the applicable service contract. Landlord shall have no obligation to provide Tenant with operational emergency generators or back-up power or to supervise, oversee or confirm that the third party maintaining the emergency generators is maintaining the generators as per the manufacturer ’ s standard guidelines or otherwise. During any period of replacement, repair or maintenance of the emergency generators when the emergency generators are not operational, including any delays thereto due to the inability to obtain parts or replacement equipment, Landlord shall have no obligation to provide Tenant with an alternative back-up generator or generators or alternative sources of back-up power. Tenant expressly acknowledges and agrees that Landlord does not guaranty that such emergency generators will be operational at all times or that emergency power will be available to the Premises when needed. 12. Alterations and Tenant ’ s Property. Any alterations, additions, or improvements made to the Premises by or on behalf of Tenant, including additional locks or bolts of any kind or nature upon any doors or windows in the Premises, but excluding installation, removal or realignment of furniture systems (other than removal of furniture systems owned or paid for by Landlord) not involving any modifications to the structure or connections (other then by ordinary plugs or jacks) to Building Systems (as defined in Section 13) (“ Alterations ”) shall be subject to Landlord ’ s prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in Landlord ’ s sole discretion if any such Alteration affects the structure or Building Systems and shall not be otherwise unreasonably withheld.

Any request for approval shall be in writing, delivered not less than 15 business days in advance of any proposed construction, and accompanied by plans, specifications, bid proposals, work contracts and such other information concerning the nature and cost of the alterations as may be reasonably requested by Landlord, including the identities and mailing addresses of all persons performing work or supplying materials. Landlord ’ s right to review plans and specifications and to monitor construction shall be solely for its own benefit, and Landlord shall have no duty to ensure that such plans and specifications or construction comply with applicable Legal Requirements. Tenant shall cause, at its sole cost and expense, all Alterations to comply with insurance requirements and with Legal Requirements and shall implement at its sole cost and expense any alteration or modification required by Legal Requirements as a result of any Alterations. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, on demand an amount equal to 3% of all charges incurred by Tenant or its contractors or agents in Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory connection with any Alteration to cover Landlord ’ s overhead and expenses for plan review, coordination, scheduling and supervision. Before Tenant begins any Alteration, Landlord may post on and about the Premises notices of non-responsibility pursuant to applicable law. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for, and indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from, any expense incurred by Landlord by reason of faulty work done by Tenant or its contractors, delays caused by such work, or inadequate cleanup. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 12 Tenant shall furnish security or make other arrangements satisfactory to Landlord to assure payment for the completion of all Alterations work free and clear of liens, and shall provide (and cause each contractor or subcontractor to provide) certificates of insurance for workers ’ compensation and other coverage in reasonable amounts and from an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to Landlord protecting Landlord against liability for personal injury or property damage during construction. Upon completion of any Alterations, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord: (i) sworn statements setting forth the names of all contractors and subcontractors who did the work and copies of final lien waivers from all such contractors and subcontractors; and (ii) “ as built ” plans for any such Alteration. Except for Removable Installations (as hereinafter defined), all Installations (as hereinafter defined) shall be and shall remain the property of Landlord during the Term and following the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, shall not be removed by Tenant at any time during the Term, and shall remain upon and be surrendered with the Premises as a part thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may, at the time its approval of any such Installation is requested, notify Tenant that Landlord requires that Tenant remove such Installation upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, in which event Tenant shall remove such Installation in accordance with the immediately succeeding sentence. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall remove (i) all wires, cables or similar equipment which Tenant has installed in the Premises or in the risers or plenums of the Building, (ii) any Installations for which Landlord has given Tenant notice of removal in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and (iii) all of Tenant ’ s Property (as hereinafter defined), and Tenant shall restore and repair any damage caused by or occasioned as a result of such removal, including, without limitation, capping off all such connections behind the walls of the Premises and repairing any holes. During any restoration period beyond the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall pay Rent to Landlord as provided herein as if said space were otherwise occupied by Tenant. If Landlord is requested by Tenant or any lender, lessor or other person or entity claiming an interest in any of Tenant ’ s Property to waive any lien Landlord may have against any of Tenant ’ s Property, and Landlord consents to such waiver, then Landlord shall be entitled to be paid as administrative rent a fee of $1,000 per occurrence for its time and effort in preparing and negotiating such a waiver of lien.

Losses and damages caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party shall be repaired by Landlord, to the extent not covered by insurance, at Tenant ’ s sole cost and expense. Landlord reserves the right to stop Building Systems services when necessary (i) by reason of accident or emergency, or (ii) for planned repairs, alterations or improvements, which are, in the judgment of Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory Landlord, desirable or necessary to be made, until said repairs, alterations or improvements shall have been completed. Landlord shall have no responsibility or liability for failure to supply Building Systems services during any such period of interruption; provided, however, that Landlord shall, except in case of emergency, make a commercially reasonable effort to give Tenant a minimum of 48 hours advance notice of any planned stoppage of Building Systems services for routine maintenance, repairs, alterations or improvements. Landlord shall endeavor to minimize interference with Tenant ’ s business operations during planned stoppages of the Building Systems. Tenant shall promptly give Landlord written notice of any repair required by Landlord pursuant to this Section, after which Landlord shall make a commercially reasonable effort to effect such repair. Landlord shall not be liable for any failure to make any repairs or to perform any maintenance unless such failure shall persist for an unreasonable time after Tenant ’ s written notice of the need for such repairs or maintenance. Tenant waives its rights under any state or local law to terminate this Lease or to make such repairs at Landlord ’ s expense and agrees that the parties ’ respective rights with respect to such matters shall be solely as set forth herein. Repairs required as the result of fire, earthquake, flood, vandalism, war, or similar cause of damage or destruction shall be controlled by Section 18. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 13 14. Tenant ’ s Repairs. Subject to Section 13 hereof, Tenant, at its expense, shall repair, replace and maintain in good condition all portions of the Premises, including, without limitation, entries, doors, ceilings, interior windows, interior walls, and the interior side of demising walls. Such repair and replacement may include capital expenditures and repairs whose benefit may extend beyond the Term. Should Tenant fail to make any such repair or replacement or fail to maintain the Premises, Landlord shall give Tenant notice of such failure. If Tenant fails to commence cure of such failure within 10 days of Landlord ’ s notice, and thereafter diligently prosecute such cure to completion, Landlord may perform such work and shall be reimbursed by Tenant within 30 days after demand therefor; provided, however, that if such failure by Tenant creates or could create an emergency, Landlord may immediately commence cure of such failure and shall thereafter be entitled to recover the costs of such cure from Tenant. Subject to Sections 17 and 18, Tenant shall bear the full uninsured cost of any repair or replacement to any part of the Project that results from damage caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party and any repair that benefits only the Premises. 15. Mechanic ’ s Liens. Tenant shall discharge, by bond or otherwise, any mechanic ’ s lien filed against the Premises or against the Project for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed to have been furnished to, Tenant within 15 days after the filing thereof, at Tenant ’ s sole cost and shall otherwise keep the Premises and the Project free from any liens arising out of work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by Tenant. Should Tenant fail to discharge any lien described herein, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pay such claim or post a bond or otherwise provide security to eliminate the lien as a claim against title to the Project and the cost thereof shall be immediately due from Tenant as Additional Rent. If Tenant shall lease or finance the acquisition of office equipment, furnishings, or other personal property of a removable nature utilized by Tenant in the operation of Tenant ’ s business, Tenant warrants that any Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement filed as a matter of public record by any lessor or creditor of Tenant will upon its face or by exhibit thereto indicate that such Financing Statement is applicable only to removable personal property of Tenant located within the Premises. In no event shall the address of the Project be furnished on the statement without qualifying language as to applicability of the lien only to removable personal property, located in an identified suite held by Tenant. 16. Indemnification. Tenant hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend, save and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all Claims for injury or death to persons or damage to property occurring within or about the Premises, arising directly or indirectly out of use or occupancy of the Premises or a breach or default by Tenant in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, unless caused solely by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Landlord. Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant assumes all risk of damage to, personal property (including, without limitation, loss of records kept within the Premises). Tenant further waives any and all Claims for injury to Tenant ’ s business or loss of income relating to any such damage or destruction of personal property (including, without limitation, any loss of records).

Landlord shall maintain all risk property and, if applicable, sprinkler damage insurance covering the full replacement cost of the Project or such lesser coverage amount as Landlord may elect provided such coverage amount is not less than 90% of such full replacement cost. Landlord shall further procure and maintain commercial general liability insurance with a single loss limit of not less than $2,000,000 for bodily injury and property damage with respect to the Project. Landlord may, but is not obligated to, maintain such other insurance and additional coverages as it may deem necessary, including, but not limited to, flood, environmental hazard and earthquake, loss or failure of building equipment, errors and omissions, rental loss during the period of repair or rebuilding, workers ’ compensation insurance and fidelity bonds for employees employed to perform services and insurance for any improvements installed by Tenant or which are in addition to the standard improvements customarily furnished by Landlord without regard to whether or not such are made a part of the Project. All such insurance shall be included as part of the Operating Expenses. The Project may be included in a blanket policy (in which case the cost of such insurance allocable to the Project will be determined by Landlord based upon the insurer ’ s cost calculations). Tenant shall also reimburse Landlord for any increased premiums or additional insurance which Landlord reasonably deems necessary as a result of Tenant ’ s use of the Premises. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall maintain during the Term: all risk property insurance with business interruption and extra expense coverage, covering the full replacement cost of all property and improvements installed or placed in the Premises by Tenant at Tenant ’ s expense; workers ’ compensation insurance with no less than the minimum limits required by law; employer ’ s liability insurance with such limits as required by law; and commercial general liability insurance, with a minimum limit of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage with respect to the Premises. The commercial general liability insurance policy shall name Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., and Landlord, its officers, directors, employees, managers, agents, invitees and contractors (collectively, “ Landlord Parties ”), as additional insureds; insure on an occurrence and not a claims-made basis; be issued by insurance companies which have a rating of not less than policyholder rating of A and financial category rating of at least Class X in “ Best ’ s Insurance Guide ”; shall not be cancelable for nonpayment of premium unless 30 days prior written notice shall have been given to Landlord from the insurer; contain a hostile fire endorsement and a contractual liability endorsement; and provide primary coverage to Landlord (any policy issued to Landlord providing duplicate or similar coverage shall be deemed excess over Tenant ’ s policies). Copies of such policies (if requested by Landlord), or certificates of insurance showing the limits of coverage required hereunder and showing Landlord as an additional insured, along with reasonable evidence of the payment of premiums for the applicable period, shall be delivered to Landlord by Tenant upon commencement of the Term and upon each renewal of said insurance. Tenant ’ s policy may be a “ blanket policy ” with an aggregate per location endorsement which specifically provides that the amount of insurance shall not be prejudiced by other losses covered by the policy. Tenant shall, at least 5 days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Landlord with renewal certificates. In each instance where insurance is to name Landlord as an additional insured, Tenant shall upon written request of Landlord also designate and furnish certificates so evidencing Landlord as additional insured to: (i) any lender of Landlord holding a security interest in the Project or any portion thereof, (ii) the landlord under any lease wherein Landlord is tenant of the real property on which the Project is located, if the interest of Landlord is or shall become that of a tenant under a ground or other underlying lease rather than that of a fee owner, and/or (iii) any management company retained by Landlord to manage the Project. The property insurance obtained by Landlord and Tenant shall include a waiver of subrogation by the insurers and all rights based upon an assignment from its insured, against Landlord or Tenant, and their respective officers, directors, employees, managers, agents, invitees and contractors (“ Related Parties ”), in connection with any loss or damage thereby insured against. Neither party nor its respective Related Parties shall be liable to the other for loss or damage caused by any risk insured against under property insurance required to be maintained hereunder, and each party waives any claims against the other party, and its respective Related Parties, for such loss or damage. The failure of a party to insure its property shall not void this waiver. Landlord and its respective Related Parties shall not be liable for, Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory and Tenant hereby waives all claims against such parties for, business interruption and losses occasioned thereby sustained by Tenant or any person claiming through Tenant resulting from any accident or occurrence in or upon the Premises or the Project from any cause whatsoever. If the foregoing waivers shall contravene any law with respect to exculpatory agreements, the liability of Landlord or Tenant shall be deemed not released but shall be secondary to the other ’ s insurer. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 15 Landlord may require insurance policy limits to be reasonably raised to conform with requirements of Landlord ’ s lender and/or to bring coverage limits to levels then being generally required of new tenants within the Project. 18. Restoration. If, at any time during the Term, the Project or the Premises are damaged or destroyed by a fire or other casualty, Landlord shall notify Tenant within 60 days after discovery of such damage as to the amount of time Landlord reasonably estimates it will take to restore the Project or the Premises, as applicable (the “ Restoration Period ”). If the Restoration Period is estimated to exceed 12 months (the “ Maximum Restoration Period ”), Landlord may, in such notice, elect to terminate this Lease as of the date that is 75 days after the date of discovery of such damage or destruction; provided, however, that notwithstanding Landlord ’ s election to restore, Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord delivered within 5 business days of receipt of a notice from Landlord estimating a Restoration Period for the Premises longer than the Maximum Restoration Period. Unless either Landlord or Tenant so elects to terminate this Lease, Landlord shall, subject to receipt of sufficient insurance proceeds (with any deductible to be treated as a current Operating Expense), promptly restore the Premises (excluding the improvements installed by Tenant or by Landlord and paid for by Tenant), subject to delays arising from the collection of insurance proceeds, from Force Majeure events or as needed to obtain any license, clearance or other authorization of any kind required to enter into and restore the Premises issued by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release, disposal, removal or remediation of Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 30) in, on or about the Premises (collectively referred to herein as “ Hazardous Materials Clearances ”); provided, however, that if repair or restoration of the Premises is not substantially complete as of the end of the Maximum Restoration Period or, if longer, the Restoration Period, Landlord may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect not to proceed with such repair and restoration, or Tenant may by written notice to Landlord delivered within 10 business days of the expiration of the Maximum Restoration Period or, if longer, the Restoration Period, elect to terminate this Lease, in which event Landlord shall be relieved of its obligation to make such repairs or restoration and this Lease shall terminate as of the date that is 75 days after the later of: (i) discovery of such damage or destruction, or (ii) the date all required Hazardous Materials Clearances are obtained, but Landlord shall retain any Rent paid and the right to any Rent payable by Tenant prior to such election by Landlord or Tenant. Tenant, at its expense, shall promptly perform, subject to delays arising from the collection of insurance proceeds, from Force Majeure (as defined in Section 34) events or to obtain Hazardous Material Clearances, all repairs or restoration not required to be done by Landlord and shall promptly re-enter the Premises and commence doing business in accordance with this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease upon written notice to the other if the Premises are damaged during the last year of the Term and Landlord reasonably estimates that it will take more than 2 months to repair such damage; provided, however, that such notice is delivered within 10 business days after the date that Landlord provides Tenant with written notice of the estimated Restoration Period. Landlord shall also have the right to terminate this Lease if insurance proceeds are not available for such restoration. Rent shall be abated from the date all required Hazardous Material Clearances, if applicable, are obtained or, if not applicable, the date of discovery of such damage or destruction, until the Premises are repaired and restored, in the proportion which the area of the Premises, if any, which is not usable by Tenant bears to the total area of the Premises, unless Landlord provides Tenant with other space during the period of repair that is suitable to Tenant, in Tenant ’ s sole but reasonable discretion, for the temporary conduct of Tenant ’ s business. Such abatement shall be the sole remedy of Tenant, and except as provided in this Section 18, Tenant waives any right to terminate the Lease by reason of damage or casualty loss. Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 16 The provisions of this Lease, including this Section 18, constitute an express agreement between Landlord and Tenant with respect to any and all damage to, or destruction of, all or any part of the Premises, or any other portion of the Project, and any statute or regulation which is now or may hereafter be in effect shall have no application to this Lease or any damage or destruction to all or any part of the Premises or any other portion of the Project, the parties hereto expressly agreeing that this Section 18 sets forth their entire understanding and agreement with respect to such matters. 19. Condemnation. If the whole or any material part of the Premises or the Project is taken for any public or quasi-public use under governmental law, ordinance, or regulation, or by right of eminent domain, or by private purchase in lieu thereof (a “ Taking ” or “ Taken ”), and the Taking would in Landlord ’ s reasonable judgment, materially interfere with or impair Landlord ’ s ownership or operation of the Project or would in the reasonable judgment of Landlord and Tenant either prevent or materially interfere with Tenant ’ s use of the Premises (as resolved, if the parties are unable to agree, by arbitration by a single arbitrator with the qualifications and experience appropriate to resolve the matter and appointed pursuant to and acting in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association), then upon written notice by Landlord this Lease shall terminate and Rent shall be apportioned as of said date. If part of the Premises shall be Taken, and this Lease is not terminated as provided above, Landlord shall promptly restore the Premises and the Project as nearly as is commercially reasonable under the circumstances to their condition prior to such partial Taking and the rentable square footage of the Building, the rentable square footage of the Premises, Tenant ’ s Share of Operating Expenses and the Rent payable hereunder during the unexpired Term shall be reduced to such extent as may be fair and reasonable under the circumstances. Upon any such Taking, Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire price or award from any such Taking without any payment to Tenant, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord Tenant ’ s interest, if any, in such award. Tenant shall have the right, to the extent that same shall not diminish Landlord ’ s award, to make a separate claim against the condemning authority (but not Landlord) for such compensation as may be separately awarded or recoverable by Tenant for moving expenses and damage to Tenant ’ s trade fixtures, if a separate award for such items is made to Tenant. Tenant hereby waives any and all rights it might otherwise have pursuant to any provision of state law to terminate this Lease upon a partial Taking of the Premises or the Project. 20. Events of Default. Each of the following events shall be a default (“ Default ”) by Tenant under this Lease: (a) Payment Defaults. Tenant shall fail to pay any installment of Rent or any other payment hereunder when due; provided, however, that Landlord will give Tenant notice and an opportunity to cure any failure to pay Rent within 3 days after Tenant ’ s receipt of any such notice not more than twice in any 12 month period without such failure to pay being a Default provided that the full payment is received within such 3 day period after Tenant ’ s receipt of notice and Tenant agrees that such notice shall be in lieu of and not in addition to, or shall be deemed to be, any notice required by law. ( b) Insurance. Any insurance required to be maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be canceled or terminated or shall expire or shall be reduced or materially changed, or Landlord shall receive a notice of nonrenewal of any such insurance and Tenant shall fail to obtain replacement insurance at least 20 days before the expiration of the current coverage. ( c) Abandonment. Tenant shall abandon the Premises. ( d) Improper Transfer. Tenant shall assign, sublease or otherwise transfer or attempt to transfer all or any portion of Tenant ’ s interest in this Lease or the Premises except as expressly permitted herein, or Tenant ’ s interest in this Lease shall be attached, executed upon, or otherwise judicially seized and such action is not released within 90 days of the action.

Landlord ’ s Remedies. ( a) Payment By Landlord; Interest. Upon a Default by Tenant hereunder, Landlord may, without waiving or releasing any obligation of Tenant hereunder, make such payment or perform such act. All sums so paid or incurred by Landlord, together with interest thereon, from the date such sums were paid or incurred, at the annual rate equal to 12% per annum or the highest rate permitted by law (the “ Default Rate ”), whichever is less, shall be payable to Landlord on demand as Additional Rent. Nothing herein shall be construed to create or impose a duty on Landlord to mitigate any damages resulting from Tenant ’ s Default hereunder. ( b) Late Payment Rent. Late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent and other sums due will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges and late charges which may be imposed on Landlord under any Mortgage covering the Premises. Therefore, if any installment of Rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within 5 days after the date such payment is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum equal to 6% of the overdue Rent as a late charge. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by Tenant. In addition to the late charge, Rent not paid when due shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the 5th day after the date due until paid. ( c) Remedies. Upon the occurrence of a Default, Landlord, at its option, without further notice or demand to Tenant, shall have in addition to all other rights and remedies provided in this Lease, at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies, each and all of which shall be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever. ( i) Terminate this Lease, or at Landlord ’ s option, Tenant ’ s right to possession only, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 18 do so, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for prosecution or any claim or damages therefor; (ii) Upon any termination of this Lease, whether pursuant to the foregoing Section 21 (c) (i) or otherwise, Landlord may recover from Tenant the following: (A) The worth at the time of award of any unpaid rent which has been earned at the time of such termination; plus (B) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus (C) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus (D) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant ’ s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, specifically including, but not limited to, brokerage commissions and advertising expenses incurred, expenses of remodeling the Premises or any portion thereof for a new tenant, whether for the same or a different use, and any special concessions reasonably made to obtain a new tenant; and (E) At Landlord ’ s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by applicable law. The term “ rent ” as used in this Section 21 shall be deemed to be and to mean all sums of every nature required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, whether to Landlord or to others. As used in Sections 21 (c) (ii) (A) and (B), above, the “ worth at the time of award ” shall be computed by allowing interest at the Default Rate. As used in Section 21 (c) (ii) (C) above, the “ worth at the time of award ” shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus 1 %. ( iii) Landlord may continue this Lease in effect after Tenant ’ s Default and recover rent as it becomes due (Landlord and Tenant hereby agreeing that Tenant has the right to sublet or assign hereunder, subject only to reasonable limitations). Accordingly, if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease following a Default by Tenant, Landlord may, from time to time, without terminating this Lease, enforce all of its rights and remedies hereunder, including the right to recover all Rent as it becomes due. ( iv) Whether or not Landlord elects to terminate this Lease following a Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have the right to terminate any and all subleases, licenses, concessions or other consensual arrangements for possession entered into by Tenant and affecting the Premises or may, in Landlord ’ s sole discretion, succeed to Tenant ’ s interest in such subleases, licenses, concessions or arrangements. Upon Landlord ’ s election to succeed to Tenant ’ s interest in any such subleases, licenses, concessions or arrangements, Tenant shall, as of the date of notice by Landlord of such election, have no further right to or interest in the rent or other consideration receivable thereunder. Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory described in Section 30 (d) hereof, at Tenant ’ s expense. ( v) Independent of the exercise of any other remedy of Landlord hereunder or under applicable law, Landlord may conduct an environmental test of the Premises as generally 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 19 (d) Effect of Exercise. Exercise by Landlord of any remedies hereunder or otherwise available shall not be deemed to be an acceptance of surrender of the Premises and/or a termination of this Lease by Landlord, it being understood that such surrender and/or termination can be effected only by the express written agreement of Landlord and Tenant. Any law, usage, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding, Landlord shall have the right at all times to enforce the provisions of this Lease in strict accordance with the terms hereof; and the failure of Landlord at any time to enforce its rights under this Lease strictly in accordance with same shall not be construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to the specific terms, provisions, and covenants of this Lease or as having modified the same and shall not be deemed a waiver of Landlord ’ s right to enforce one or more of its rights in connection with any subsequent default. A receipt by Landlord of Rent or other payment with knowledge of the breach of any covenant hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach, and no waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by Landlord. To the greatest extent permitted by law, Tenant waives the service of notice of Landlord ’ s intention to re-enter, re- take or otherwise obtain possession of the Premises as provided in any statute, or to institute legal proceedings to that end, and also waives all right of redemption in case Tenant shall be dispossessed by a judgment or by warrant of any court or judge. Any reletting of the Premises or any portion thereof shall be on such terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion may determine. Landlord shall not be liable for, nor shall Tenant ’ s obligations hereunder be diminished because of, Landlord ’ s failure to relet the Premises or collect rent due in respect of such reletting or otherwise to mitigate any damages arising by reason of Tenant ’ s Default. 22. Assignment and Subletting. ( a) General Prohibition. Without Landlord ’ s prior written consent subject to and on the conditions described in this Section 22, other than pursuant to a Permitted Assignment (as defined below), Tenant shall not, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or by operation of law, assign this Lease or sublease the Premises or any part thereof or mortgage, pledge, or hypothecate its leasehold interest or grant any concession or license within the Premises, and any attempt to do any of the foregoing shall be void and of no effect. If Tenant is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, the shares or other ownership interests thereof which are not actively traded upon a stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market, a transfer or series of transfers whereby 25% or more of the issued and outstanding shares or other ownership interests of such corporation are, or voting control is, transferred (but excepting transfers upon deaths of individual owners) from a person or persons or entity or entities which were owners thereof at time of execution of this Lease to persons or entities who were not owners of shares or other ownership interests of the corporation, partnership or limited liability company at time of execution of this Lease, shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease requiring the consent of Landlord as provided in this Section 22. ( b) Permitted Transfers. If Tenant desires to assign, sublease, hypothecate or otherwise transfer this Lease or sublet the Premises, then at least 15 business days, but not more than 45 business days, before the date Tenant desires the assignment or sublease to be effective (the “ Assignment Date ”), Tenant shall give Landlord a notice (the “ Assignment Notice ”) containing such information about the proposed assignee or sublessee, including the proposed use of the Premises and any Hazardous Materials proposed to be used, stored handled, treated, generated in or released or disposed of from the Premises, the Assignment Date, any relationship between Tenant and the proposed assignee or sublessee, and all material terms and conditions of the proposed assignment or sublease, including a copy of any proposed assignment or sublease in its final form, and such other information that may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to Landlord in its consideration whether to grant its consent. Landlord may, by giving written notice to Tenant within 15 business days after receipt of the Assignment Notice and without unreasonably withholding, delaying or conditioning its consent: (i) grant such consent, (ii) refuse such consent in its reasonable discretion; or (iii) terminate this Lease with respect to the space described in the Assignment Notice as of the Assignment Date (an “ Assignment Termination ”). Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 20 Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory Landlord shall not unreasonably delay its response to an Assignment Notice delivered to Landlord by Tenant. Among other reasons, it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent in any of these instances: (1) the proposed assignee or subtenant is a governmental agency; (2) in Landlord ’ s reasonable judgment, the use of the Premises by the proposed assignee or subtenant would entail any alterations that would lessen the value of the leasehold improvements in the Premises, or would require increased services by Landlord; (3) in Landlord ’ s reasonable judgment, the proposed assignee or subtenant is engaged in areas of scientific research or other business concerns that are controversial such that they may (i) attract or cause negative publicity for or about the Building or the Project, (ii) negatively affect the reputation of the Building, the Project or Landlord, (iii) attract protestors to the Building or the Project, or (iv) lessen the attractiveness of the Building or the Project to any tenants or prospective tenants, purchasers or lenders; (4) in Landlord ’ s reasonable judgment, the proposed assignee or subtenant lacks the creditworthiness to support the financial obligations it will incur under the proposed assignment or sublease; (5) in Landlord ’ s reasonable judgment, the character, reputation, or business of the proposed assignee or subtenant is inconsistent with the desired tenant-mix or the quality of other tenancies in the Project or is inconsistent with the type and quality of the nature of the Building; (6) Landlord has received from any prior landlord to the proposed assignee or subtenant a negative report concerning such prior landlord ’ s experience with the proposed assignee or subtenant; (7) Landlord has experienced previous defaults by or is in litigation with the proposed assignee or subtenant; (8) the use of the Premises by the proposed assignee or subtenant will violate any applicable Legal Requirement; (9) the proposed assignee or subtenant, or any entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the proposed assignee or subtenant, is then an occupant of the Project; (10) the proposed assignee or subtenant is an entity with whom Landlord is actively or has been negotiating to lease space in the Project within 90 days of the Assignment Notice; or (11) the assignment or sublease is prohibited by Landlord ’ s lender. If Landlord delivers notice of its election to exercise an Assignment Termination, Tenant shall have the right to withdraw such Assignment Notice by written notice to Landlord of such election within 5 business days after Landlord ’ s notice electing to exercise the Assignment Termination. If Tenant withdraws such Assignment Notice, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If Tenant does not withdraw such Assignment Notice, this Lease, and the term and estate herein granted, shall terminate as of the Assignment Date with respect to the space described in such Assignment Notice. No failure of Landlord to exercise any such option to terminate this Lease, or to deliver a timely notice in response to the Assignment Notice, shall be deemed to be Landlord ’ s consent to the proposed assignment, sublease or other transfer. Tenant shall pay to Landlord a fee equal to One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($ 1,500) in connection with its consideration of each Assignment Notice and/or its preparation or review of any consent documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord ’ s consent to an assignment of this Lease or a subletting of any portion of the Premises to any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Tenant (a “ Control Permitted Assignment ”) shall not be required, provided that Landlord shall have the right to approve the form of any such sublease or assignment. In addition, Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease, upon 30 days prior written notice to Landlord but without obtaining Landlord ’ s prior written consent, to a corporation or other entity which is a successor-in-interest to Tenant, by way of merger, consolidation or corporate reorganization, or by the purchase of all or substantially all of the assets or the ownership interests of Tenant provided that (i) such merger or consolidation, or such acquisition or assumption, as the case may be, is for a good business purpose and not principally for the purpose of transferring the Lease, and (ii) the net worth (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“ GAAP ”) ) of the assignee is not less than the greater of the net worth (as determined in accordance with GAAP) of Tenant as of (A) the Commencement Date, or (B) as of the date of Tenant ’ s most current quarterly or annual financial statements, and (iii) such assignee shall agree in writing to assume all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease arising after the effective date of the assignment (a “ Corporate Permitted Assignment ”). Control Permitted Assignments and Corporate Permitted Assignments are hereinafter referred to as “ Permitted Assignments. ” (c) Additional Conditions. As a condition to any such assignment or subletting, whether or not Landlord ’ s consent is required, Landlord may require: (i) that any assignee or subtenant agree, in writing at the time of such assignment or subletting, that if Landlord gives such party notice that Tenant is in default under this Lease, Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 21 such party shall thereafter make all payments otherwise due Tenant directly to Landlord, which payments will be received by Landlord without any liability except to credit such payment against those due under the Lease, and any such third party shall agree to attorn to Landlord or its successors and assigns should this Lease be terminated for any reason; provided, however, in no event shall Landlord or its successors or assigns be obligated to accept such attornment; and (ii) A list of Hazardous Materials, certified by the proposed assignee or sublessee to be true and correct, which the proposed assignee or sublessee intends to use, store, handle, treat, generate in or release or dispose of from the Premises, together with copies of all documents relating to such use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of Hazardous Materials by the proposed assignee or subtenant in the Premises or on the Project, prior to the proposed assignment or subletting, including, without limitation: permits; approvals; reports and correspondence; storage and management plans; plans relating to the installation of any storage tanks to be installed in or under the Project (provided, said installation of tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has given its written consent to do so, which consent may be withheld in Landlord ’ s sole and absolute discretion); and all closure plans or any other documents required by any and all federal, state and local Governmental Authorities for any storage tanks installed in, on or under the Project for the closure of any such tanks. Neither Tenant nor any such proposed assignee or subtenant is required, however, to provide Landlord with any portion (s) of the such documents containing information of a proprietary nature which, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous Materials or hazardous activities. ( d) No Release of Tenant, Sharing of Excess Rents. Notwithstanding any assignment or subletting, Tenant and any guarantor or surety of Tenant ’ s obligations under this Lease shall at all times remain fully and primarily responsible and liable for the payment of Rent and for compliance with all of Tenant ’ s other obligations under this Lease. Except in the case of a Permitted Assignment, if the Rent due and payable by a sublessee or assignee (or a combination of the rental payable under such sublease or assignment plus any bonus or other consideration therefor or incident thereto in any form) exceeds the sum of the rental payable under this Lease, (excluding however, any Rent payable under this Section) and actual and reasonable brokerage fees, legal costs and any design or construction fees directly related to and required pursuant to the terms of any such sublease) (“ Excess Rent ”), then Tenant shall be bound and obligated to pay Landlord as Additional Rent hereunder 50% of such Excess Rent within 10 days following receipt thereof by Tenant. If Tenant shall sublet the Premises or any part thereof, Tenant hereby immediately and irrevocably assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant ’ s obligations under this Lease, all rent from any such subletting, and Landlord as assignee and as attorney-in-fact for Tenant, or a receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord ’ s application, may collect such rent and apply it toward Tenant ’ s obligations under this Lease; except that, until the occurrence of a Default, Tenant shall have the right to collect such rent. ( e) No Waiver. The consent by Landlord to an assignment or subletting shall not relieve Tenant or any assignees of this Lease or any sublessees of the Premises from obtaining the consent of Landlord to any further assignment or subletting nor shall it release Tenant or any assignee or sublessee of Tenant from full and primary liability under the Lease. The acceptance of Rent hereunder, or the acceptance of performance of any other term, covenant, or condition thereof, from any other person or entity shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease or a consent to any subletting, assignment or other transfer of the Premises. ( f) Prior Conduct of Proposed Transferee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 22, if (i) the proposed assignee or sublessee of Tenant has been required by any prior landlord, lender or Governmental Authority to take remedial action in connection with Hazardous Materials contaminating a property, where the contamination resulted from such party ’ s action or use of the property in question, (ii) the proposed assignee or sublessee is subject to an enforcement order issued by any Governmental Authority in connection with the use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of Hazardous Materials (including, without limitation, any order related to the failure to make a required reporting to any Governmental Authority), or (iii) because of the existence of a pre-existing environmental condition in the vicinity of or underlying the Project, the risk that Landlord would be Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory targeted as a responsible party in connection with the remediation of such pre-existing environmental condition would be materially increased or exacerbated by the proposed use of Hazardous Materials by such proposed assignee or sublessee, Landlord shall have the absolute right to refuse to consent to any assignment or subletting to any such party. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 22 23. Estoppel Certificate. Tenant shall, within 10 business days of written notice from Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver a statement in writing in any form reasonably requested by a proposed lender or purchaser, (i) certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease as so modified is in full force and effect) and the dates to which the rental and other charges are paid in advance, if any, (ii) acknowledging that there are not any uncured defaults on the part of Landlord hereunder, or specifying such defaults if any are claimed, and (iii) setting forth such further information with respect to the status of this Lease or the Premises as may be requested thereon. Any such statement may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of all or any portion of the real property of which the Premises are a part. Tenant ’ s failure to deliver such statement within such time shall, at the option of Landlord, constitute a Default under this Lease, and, in any event, shall be conclusive upon Tenant that the Lease is in full force and effect and without modification except as may be represented by Landlord in any certificate prepared by Landlord and delivered to Tenant for execution. Upon request by Tenant no more than once in any 12 month period during the Term, Landlord will similarly execute an estoppel certificate: (i) certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease as so modified is in full force and effect) and the dates to which the rental and other charges are paid in advanced, if any, and (ii) acknowledging that there are not, to Landlord ’ s knowledge, any Defaults on the part of Tenant hereunder, or specifying such Defaults if any are claimed. 24. Quiet Enjoyment. So long as Tenant is not in Default under this Lease, Tenant shall, subject to the terms of this Lease, at all times during the Term, have peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the Premises against any person claiming by, through or under Landlord. 25. Prorations. All prorations required or permitted to be made hereunder shall be made on the basis of a 360 day year and 30 day months. 26. Rules and Regulations. Tenant shall, at all times during the Term and any extension thereof, comply with all reasonable rules and regulations at any time or from time to time established by Landlord covering use of the Premises and the Project. The current rules and regulations are attached hereto as Exhibit E. If there is any conflict between said rules and regulations and other provisions of this Lease, the terms and provisions of this Lease shall control. Landlord shall not have any liability or obligation for the breach of any rules or regulations by other tenants in the Project and shall not enforce such rules and regulations in a discriminatory manner. 27. Subordination. This Lease and Tenant ’ s interest and rights hereunder are hereby made and shall be subject and subordinate at all times to the lien of any Mortgage now existing or hereafter created on or against the Project or the Premises, and all amendments, restatements, renewals, modifications, consolidations, refinancing, assignments and extensions thereof, without the necessity of any further instrument or act on the part of Tenant; provided, however that so long as there is no Default hereunder, Tenant ’ s right to possession of the Premises shall not be disturbed by the Holder of any such Mortgage. Tenant agrees, at the election of the Holder of any such Mortgage, to attorn to any such Holder. Tenant agrees upon demand to execute, acknowledge and deliver such instruments, confirming such subordination, and such instruments of attornment as shall be requested by any such Holder, provided any such instruments contain appropriate non-disturbance provisions assuring Tenant ’ s quiet enjoyment of the Premises as set forth in Section 24 hereof. Tenant hereby appoints Landlord attorney-in-fact for Tenant irrevocably (such power of attorney being coupled with an interest) to execute, acknowledge and deliver any such instrument and instruments for and in the name of Tenant and to cause any such instrument to be recorded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Holder may at any time subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease, without Tenant ’ s consent, by notice in writing to Tenant, and Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory thereupon this Lease shall be deemed prior to such Mortgage without regard to their respective dates of execution, delivery or recording and in that event such Holder shall have the same rights with respect to this Lease as though this Lease had been executed prior to the execution, delivery and recording of such Mortgage and had been assigned to such Holder. The term “ Mortgage ” whenever used in this Lease shall be deemed to include deeds of trust, security assignments and any other encumbrances, and any reference to the “ Holder ” of a Mortgage shall be deemed to include the beneficiary under a deed of trust. Landlord represents and warrants that as of the date of this Lease, there is no existing Mortgage encumbering the Project. Upon written request from Tenant, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to obtain for execution by Tenant a commercially reasonable form of non-disturbance and attornment agreement executed by the Holder of any future Mortgage with a lien on the Project which provides, among other things, that so long as Tenant is not in Default of its obligations under this Lease, foreclosure or other enforcement of such Mortgage shall not terminate this Lease and the successor to Landlord ’ s interest in the Project shall recognize this Lease and Tenant ’ s right to possession of the Premises. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 23 28. Surrender. Upon the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of Tenant ’ s right of possession, Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord in the same condition as received, subject to any Alterations or Installations permitted by Landlord to remain in the Premises, free of Hazardous Materials brought upon, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated in, or released or disposed of from, the Premises by any person other than a Landlord Party (collectively, “ Tenant HazMat Operations ”) and released of all Hazardous Materials Clearances, broom clean, ordinary wear and tear and casualty loss and condemnation covered by Sections 18 and 19 excepted. At least 3 months prior to the surrender of the Premises, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a narrative description of the actions proposed (or required by any Governmental Authority) to be taken by Tenant in order to surrender the Premises (including any Installations permitted by Landlord to remain in the Premises) at the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, free from any residual impact from the Tenant HazMat Operations and otherwise released for unrestricted use and occupancy (the “ Surrender Plan ”). Such Surrender Plan shall be accompanied by a current listing of (i) all Hazardous Materials licenses and permits held by or on behalf of any Tenant Party with respect to the Premises, and (ii) all Hazardous Materials used, stored, handled, treated, generated, released or disposed of from the Premises, and shall be subject to the review and approval of Landlord ’ s environmental consultant. In connection with the review and approval of the Surrender Plan, upon the request of Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord or its consultant such additional non-proprietary information concerning Tenant HazMat Operations as Landlord shall request. On or before such surrender, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord evidence that the approved Surrender Plan shall have been satisfactorily completed and Landlord shall have the right, subject to reimbursement at Tenant ’ s expense as set forth below, to cause Landlord ’ s environmental consultant to inspect the Premises and perform such additional procedures as may be deemed reasonably necessary to confirm that the Premises are, as of the effective date of such surrender or early termination of the Lease, free from any residual impact from Tenant HazMat Operations. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as Additional Rent, for the actual out-of pocket expense incurred by Landlord for Landlord ’ s environmental consultant to review and approve the Surrender Plan and to visit the Premises and verify satisfactory completion of the same, which cost shall not exceed $5,000. Landlord shall have the unrestricted right to deliver such Surrender Plan and any report by Landlord ’ s environmental consultant with respect to the surrender of the Premises to third parties. If Tenant shall fail to prepare or submit a Surrender Plan approved by Landlord, or if Tenant shall fail to complete the approved Surrender Plan, or if such Surrender Plan, whether or not approved by Landlord, shall fail to adequately address any residual effect of Tenant HazMat Operations in, on or about the Premises, Landlord shall have the right to take such actions as Landlord may deem reasonable or appropriate to assure that the Premises and the Project are surrendered free from any residual impact from Tenant HazMat Operations, the cost of which actions shall be reimbursed by Tenant as Additional Rent, without regard to the limitation set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 28. Tenant shall immediately return to Landlord all keys and/or access cards to parking, the Project, restrooms or all or any portion of the Premises furnished to or otherwise procured by Tenant. If any such access card or key is lost, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, at Landlord ’ s election, either the cost of replacing Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory such lost access card or key or the cost of reprogramming the access security system in which such access card was used or changing the lock or locks opened by such lost key. Any Tenant ’ s Property, Alterations and property not so removed by Tenant as permitted or required herein shall be deemed abandoned and may be stored, removed, and disposed of by Landlord at Tenant ’ s expense, and Tenant waives all claims against Landlord for any damages resulting from Landlord ’ s retention and/or disposition of such property. All obligations of Tenant hereunder not fully performed as of the termination of the Term, including the obligations of Tenant under Section 30 hereof, shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, including, without limitation, indemnity obligations, payment obligations with respect to Rent and obligations concerning the condition and repair of the Premises. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 24 29. Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TENANT AND LANDLORD WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO HAVE A JURY PARTICIPATE IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT ARISING OUT OF THIS LEASE OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT, OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO. 30. Environmental Requirements. ( a) Prohibition/Compliance/Indemnity. Tenant shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Materials (as hereinafter defined) to be brought upon, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated in or about, or released or disposed of from, the Premises or the Project in violation of applicable Environmental Requirements (as hereinafter defined) by Tenant or any Tenant Party. If Tenant breaches the obligation stated in the preceding sentence, or if the presence of Hazardous Materials in the Premises during the Term or any holding over results in contamination of the Premises, the Project or any adjacent property or if contamination of the Premises, the Project or any adjacent property by Hazardous Materials brought into, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated in or about, or released or disposed of from, the Premises by anyone other than Landlord and Landlord ’ s employees, agents and contractors otherwise occurs during the Term or any holding over, Tenant hereby indemnifies and shall defend and hold Landlord, its officers, directors, employees, agents and contractors harmless from any and all actions (including, without limitation, remedial or enforcement actions of any kind, administrative or judicial proceedings, and orders or judgments arising out of or resulting therefrom), costs, claims, damages (including, without limitation, punitive damages and damages based upon diminution in value of the Premises or the Project, or the loss of, or restriction on, use of the Premises or any portion of the Project), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys ’, consultants ’ and experts ’ fees, court costs and amounts paid in settlement of any claims or actions), fines, forfeitures or other civil, administrative or criminal penalties, injunctive or other relief (whether or not based upon personal injury, property damage, or contamination of, or adverse effects upon, the environment, water tables or natural resources), liabilities or losses (collectively, “ Environmental Claims ”) which arise during or after the Term as a result of such contamination. This indemnification of Landlord by Tenant includes, without limitation, costs incurred in connection with any investigation of site conditions or any cleanup, treatment, remedial, removal, or restoration work required by any federal, state or local Governmental Authority because of Hazardous Materials present in the air, soil or ground water above, on, or under the Premises. Without limiting the foregoing, if the presence of any Hazardous Materials on the Premises, the Project or any adjacent property caused or permitted by Tenant or any Tenant Party results in any contamination of the Premises, the Project or any adjacent property, Tenant shall promptly take all actions at its sole expense and in accordance with applicable Environmental Requirements as are necessary to return the Premises, the Project or any adjacent property to the condition existing prior to the time of such contamination, provided that Landlord ’ s approval of such action shall first be obtained, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld so long as such actions would not potentially have any material adverse long-term or short-term effect on the Premises or the Project. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 30, Tenant shall not be responsible for, and the indemnification and hold harmless obligation set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to (i) contamination in the Premises which Tenant can prove to Landlord ’ s reasonable satisfaction existed in the Premises immediately prior to the Commencement Date, or (ii) the presence of any Hazardous Materials in the Premises which Tenant can prove to Landlord ’ s reasonable satisfaction migrated from outside of the Premises into the Premises, Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory unless in either case, the presence of such Hazardous Materials (x) is the result of a breach by Tenant of any of its obligations under this Lease, or (y) was caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party or (z) was exacerbated by Tenant or any Tenant Party. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 25 (b) Business. Landlord acknowledges that it is not the intent of this Section 30 to prohibit Tenant from using the Premises for the Permitted Use. Tenant may operate its business according to prudent industry practices so long as the use or presence of Hazardous Materials is strictly and properly monitored according to all then applicable Environmental Requirements. As a material inducement to Landlord to allow Tenant to use Hazardous Materials in connection with its business, Tenant agrees to deliver to Landlord prior to the Commencement Date a list identifying each type of Hazardous Materials to be brought upon, kept, used, stored, handled, treated, generated on, or released or disposed of from, the Premises as of the Commencement Date and setting forth any and all governmental approvals or permits required in connection with the presence, use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of such Hazardous Materials on or from the Premises (“ Hazardous Materials List ”). Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an updated Hazardous Materials List at least once a year and, upon request from Landlord, Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord any update to Tenant ’ s Hazardous Materials Business Plan inventory on record with the City and/or County of San Diego. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord true and correct copies of the following documents (the “ Haz Mat Documents ”) relating to the use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of Hazardous Materials prior to the Commencement Date, or if unavailable at that time, concurrent with the receipt from or submission to a Governmental Authority: permits; approvals; reports and correspondence; storage and management plans, notice of any pending violations of applicable Legal Requirements; plans relating to the installation of any storage tanks to be installed in or under the Project (provided, said installation of tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has given Tenant its written consent to do so, which consent may be withheld in Landlord ’ s sole and absolute discretion); all closure plans or any other documents required by all federal, state and local Governmental Authorities as applicable for any storage tanks installed in, on or under the Project for the closure of any such tanks; and a Surrender Plan (to the extent surrender in accordance with Section 28 cannot be accomplished in 3 months). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant is not required, however, to provide Landlord with any portion (s) of the Haz Mat Documents containing information of a proprietary nature which, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous Materials or hazardous activities. It is not the intent of this Section to provide Landlord with information which could be detrimental to Tenant ’ s business should such information become possessed by Tenant ’ s competitors. ( c) Tenant Representation and Warranty. Tenant hereby represents and warrants to Landlord that (i) neither Tenant nor any of its legal predecessors has been required by any prior landlord, lender or Governmental Authority at any time to take remedial action in connection with Hazardous Materials contaminating a property which contamination was permitted by Tenant of such predecessor or resulted from Tenant ’ s or such predecessor ’ s action or use of the property in question and which were not adequately addressed or corrected by Tenant, and (ii) Tenant is not subject to any enforcement order issued by any Governmental Authority in connection with the use, storage, handling, treatment, generation, release or disposal of Hazardous Materials (including, without limitation, any order related to the failure to make a required reporting to any Governmental Authority) that has not been adequately addressed and corrected by Tenant. If Landlord determines that this representation and warranty was not true as of the date of this lease, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease in Landlord ’ s sole and absolute discretion. ( d) Testing. Upon 30 days prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have the right to conduct annual environmental tests of the Premises to determine whether any contamination of the Premises or the Project has occurred as a result of Tenant ’ s use. Tenant shall only be required to pay the cost of such annual environmental test of the Premises if it is revealed that Tenant has not complied with any Environmental Requirement or if contamination for which Tenant is responsible under this Lease is identified. Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate with one another to schedule such testing at a mutually acceptable time for both parties. Tenant shall have the right to have a representative present during such testing and shall be permitted to conduct its own testing concurrent with Landlord ’ s testing activities. All sample collection, testing, analysis and reporting will be performed by a duly accredited laboratory for any Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory testing performed by Landlord and/or Tenant, following well established and validated regulatory environmental protocols. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant, at Tenant ’ s expense, conducts its own tests of the Premises using third party contractors and test procedures acceptable to Landlord which tests are certified to Landlord, Landlord shall accept such tests in lieu of the annual tests to be paid for by Tenant. In addition, at any time, and from time to time, prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Landlord shall have the right to conduct appropriate tests of the Premises and the Project to determine if contamination has occurred as a result of Tenant ’ s use of the Premises. In connection with such testing, upon the request of Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord or its consultant such non-proprietary information concerning the use of Hazardous Materials in or about the Premises by Tenant or any Tenant Party. If contamination has occurred for which Tenant is liable under this Section 30, Tenant shall pay all costs to conduct such tests. If no such contamination is found, Landlord shall pay the costs of such tests (which shall not constitute an Operating Expense). Landlord shall provide Tenant with a copy of all third party, non-confidential reports and tests of the Premises made by or on behalf of Landlord during the Term without representation or warranty and subject to a confidentiality agreement. Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly and satisfactorily remediate any environmental conditions identified by such testing for which Tenant is responsible for under this Lease and in accordance with all Environmental Requirements. Landlord ’ s receipt of or satisfaction with any environmental assessment in no way waives any rights which Landlord may have against Tenant. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 26 (e) Control Areas.

For purposes of this Section 39 (a), “ Expansion Space ” shall mean that certain approximately 15,136 rentable square feet on the first floor of the Building as more particularly shown on Exhibit H, which is not occupied by a tenant or which is occupied by a then existing tenant whose lease is expiring within 9 months or less and such tenant does not wish to renew (whether or not such tenant has a right to renew) its occupancy of such space, plus any basement space in the Building which may be described in the Pending Deal Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, Tenant shall be entitled to exercise its right under this Section 39 (a) only with respect to the entire Expansion Space described in such Pending Deal Notice which shall include an obligation on the part of Tenant to lease along with the Expansion Space any basement space in the Building described in the Pending Deal Notice. Within 5 business days after Tenant ’ s receipt of the Pending Deal Notice, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord written notice (the “ Space Acceptance Notice ”) if Tenant elects to lease the Expansion Space. Tenant ’ s right to receive the Pending Deal Notice and election to lease or not lease the Expansion Space pursuant to this Section 39 (a) is hereinafter referred to as the “ Right of First Refusal. ” If Tenant elects to lease the Expansion Space described in the Pending Deal Notice by delivering the Space Acceptance Notice within the required 5 business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to agree to lease the Expansion Space on the same general terms and conditions as this Lease except that the terms of this Lease shall be modified to reflect the terms of the Pending Deal Notice for the rental of the Expansion Space; provided, however that if Landlord delivers a Pending Deal Notice within the first 12 months after the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant may elect in its Space Acceptance Notice to lease the Expansion Space pursuant to the Expansion Right Terms (as defined below) rather than the terms of the Pending Deal Notice, in which case the terms of this Lease shall be modified to reflect the terms of the Expansion Right Terms for the Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWD Net Multi-Tenant Laboratory rental of the Expansion Space. Tenant acknowledges that the term of the Lease with respect to the Expansion Space and the Term of the Lease with respect to the original Premises may not be co- terminous if Tenant elects to lease the Expansion Space pursuant to the terms set forth in the Pending Deal Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Work Letter or the TI Allowance apply to the Expansion Space. If Tenant fails to deliver a Space Acceptance Notice to Landlord within the required 5 business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section 39 (a) to lease the Expansion Space, and Landlord shall have the right to lease the Expansion Space to any third party on any terms and conditions acceptable to Landlord. 11119 N. Torrey Pines/Ligand - Page 30 (b) Expansion Right. Commencing on the Rent Commencement Date and continuing through the date that is 12 months after the Rent Commencement Date (“ Expansion Right Expiration Date ”), if and for so long as the Expansion Space is available for lease, Tenant shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to expand (“ Direct Expansion Right ”) the Premises to include all and not less than all of the Expansion Space by delivery of written notice to Landlord of its election to exercise the Direct Expansion Right (“ Expansion Exercise Notice ”).

Tenant ’ s failure to timely deliver an Expansion Exercise Notice to Landlord shall be deemed to be an election by Tenant not to exercise Tenant ’ s Direct Expansion Right pursuant to this Section 39 (b) with respect to the Expansion Space, in which case Tenant shall be deemed to have forever waived its rights under this Section 39 (b) and this Section 39 (b) shall be of no further force or effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 39 (b), Tenant acknowledges and agrees that (x) Landlord is under no obligation to keep the Expansion Space vacant from the date hereof until the Expansion Right Expiration Date and, prior to Tenant ’ s election to exercise its Direct Expansion Right, Landlord is free to lease the Expansion Space at any time to any party and on any terms and conditions acceptable to Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion, and (y) if Landlord leases the Expansion Space to any other party, Tenant ’ s Direct Expansion Right shall immediately terminate and Tenant shall have no further to exercise its Direct Expansion Right. ( c) Amended Lease. If: (i) Tenant fails to timely deliver a Space Acceptance Notice or Expansion Exercise Notice, or (ii) after the expiration of a period of 10 days after Landlord ’ s delivery to Tenant of a lease amendment or lease agreement for Tenant ’ s lease of the Expansion Space, no lease amendment or lease agreement (including the work letter) for the Expansion Space, acceptable to both parties each in their sole and absolute discretion, has been executed, Tenant shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, be deemed to have forever waived its right to lease such Expansion Space.

( e) Termination. The Direct Expansion Right and Right of First Refusal shall, at Landlord ’ s option, terminate and be of no further force or effect even after Tenant ’ s due and timely exercise of the Direct Expansion Right or Right of First Refusal, as applicable, , if, after such exercise, but prior to the commencement date of the lease of such Expansion Space, (i) Tenant fails to timely cure any default by Tenant under the Lease; or (ii) Tenant has Defaulted 3 or more times during the period from the date of the exercise of the Direct Expansion Right or Right of First Refusal, as applicable, to the date of the commencement of the lease of the Expansion Space, whether or not such Defaults are cured.

If, on or before the date which is 180 days prior to the expiration of the Base Term of this Lease, Tenant has not agreed with Landlord ’ s determination of the Market Rate and the rent escalations during the Extension Term after negotiating in good faith, Tenant shall be deemed to have elected arbitration as described in Section 40 (b).

If both parties submit Extension Proposals, then Landlord and Tenant shall meet within 7 days after delivery of the last Extension Proposal and make a good faith attempt to mutually appoint a single Arbitrator (and defined below) to determine the Market Rate and escalations. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon a single Arbitrator, then each shall, by written notice delivered to the other within 10 days after the meeting, select an Arbitrator. If either party fails to timely give notice of its selection for an Arbitrator, the other party ’ s submitted proposal shall determine the Base Rent for the Extension Term. The 2 Arbitrators so appointed shall, within 5 business days after their appointment, appoint a third Arbitrator.
